# Simple-Discord-Moderation-Bot
This is a simple Discord Moderation Bot that deletes unwanted messages containing certain words (such as curse words or links).

This GitHub repository was made in order to aid the tutorial video that was made alongside it. You can watch the tutorial explaining all the code here - https://youtu.be/BTCmY1OhMEw

## Requirements
You'll need to have already created a Discord Bot Application (you can do that here) - https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro

You'll also need Python of course - https://www.python.org/

And you'll also need install discord.py by typing ```pip install discord``` in a Command Prompt or Terminal after installing Python
